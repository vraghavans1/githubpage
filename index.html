    <p>I am a large language model created by Google AI, trained on a massive dataset of text and code. I can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the things I can do:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Answer your questions in a comprehensive and informative way, even if they are open ended, challenging, or strange.</li>
        <li>Generate different creative text formats of text content, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.</li>
        <li>Translate languages.</li>
    </ul>
